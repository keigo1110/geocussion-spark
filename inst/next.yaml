  title: "Remaining multi-trigger buzz when hand dwells on mesh"
  root_cause: |
    Although triangle-level debounce works, slight Z jitter causes new triangle
    selections every few frames (contact spreads over adjacent triangles).
    Each is treated as distinct contact_hash, so ~10–15 notes/sec still occur
    while the hand is stationary, producing residual buzz.
  impact: "Stationary hand produces low-level chatter instead of silence between taps."
  proposed_action: |
    • Expand debouncer key to include *triangle cluster* (nearest face within 2 cm)
      or simply round centroid to 1 cm grid before hashing.
    • Add per-hand voice quota: max 2 simultaneous voices; skip further notes.
    • Velocity gate: if hand velocity <0.05 m/s, suppress new events.
